## Education
* **2010--2015** Ph.D. Computer Science, University of Colorado
* **2008--2010** M.S. Computer Science, University of Colorado
* **2004--2007** B.S. Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin
    
## Ph.D. Thesis

**DSLs and Search for Linear Algebra Performance**

*Advisor:* Elizabeth Jessup

I designed search algorithms and ran performance testing for two domain-specific languages, in the domains of matrix and tensor algebra.  These languages allow the user to specify high-level mathematical kernels, and the search algorithms automatically test many code transformations and optimizations, searching for best performance on CPUs and GPUs.

## Master's Thesis

**Genetic Algorithms with Chaotic Population Dynamics**

*Advisor:* Elizabeth Bradley

I created a genetic algorithm with a population that could grow and shrink periodically or chaotically.  I then evaluated the algorithm's performance under fixed, periodic, and chaotic populations in solving optimization problems.

## Work Experience

2010-2015: Research Assistant, Argonne National Labs

2008: Software Developer, Alliance Tech, Austin, Texas
