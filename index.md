## Who am I?

I teach computer science instructor at the University of Colorado. I\'m
interested in numerical computation, languages and compilers, and
computer science pedagogy.

## Courses I teach

I'm currently teaching for the post-baccalaurate program.  I teach:

- [CSCI 2270: Data Structures](https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?search=CSCI+2270)
- [CSCI 2400: Computer Systems](https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?search=CSCI+2400)
- [CSCI 3308: Software Development Tools and  Methods](https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?search=CSCI+3308)
- [CSCI 3155: Principles and Practice of Programming Languages](https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?search=CSCI+3155)


## Education

-   **2010\--2015** Ph.D. Computer Science, University of Colorado
-   **2008\--2010** M.S. Computer Science, University of Colorado
-   **2004\--2007** B.S. Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin

## Ph.D. Thesis

**DSLs and Search for Linear Algebra Performance**\
\
Advisor: Elizabeth Jessup\
I designed search algorithms and ran performance testing for two
domain-specific languages, in the domains of matrix and tensor algebra.
These languages allow the user to specify high-level mathematical
kernels, and the search algorithms automatically test many code
transformations and optimizations, searching for best performance on
CPUs and GPUs.

## Master\'s Thesis

**Genetic Algorithms with Chaotic Population Dynamics**\
\
Advisor: Elizabeth Bradley\
I created a genetic algorithm with a population that could grow and
shrink periodically or chaotically. I then evaluated the algorithm\'s
performance under fixed, periodic, and chaotic populations in solving
optimization problems.
